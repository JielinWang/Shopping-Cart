# Shopping-Cart -- Build Restocking Functionality 

## To accomplish this

<p>Moke sure you have login and create your Strapi API</p>
<p>you’ll need to make a call to a Strapi API and get a fresh list of available products</p>

## Here’s how the reset stock feature works:

- There’s an input field on the page that contains the URL to the Strapi back end
- When a user clicks the “ReStock Products” button, a call is made to the Strapi back end specified in the input field
- The result of this call is an updated list of products

## How to run:

Use "go live" extension on VS code while on index file. Click items to add them to your cart. Click "restock items" for a fresh list of items
